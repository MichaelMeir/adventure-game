However, he doesn’t think of himself as a good story creator, and asks a friend for help. \nAs they share the same Discord group, they both agree that making a silly game, based on their silly corner of internet madness, and full of references that no one outside the Discord will get, is a good idea. And so, the work began. \n\nIf you’re reading this, the coding and story were finished and combined into a game, and we both hope you’ll enjoy the end result.\n"

If you knew the apple was full of worms and the rock a geode, would you still pick the apple?” \nShe puts down her teacup. “You cannot know what is on the inside.

It lets us meet strangers and potentially make new friends, friends who will be with us for many years to come.” \nWith a smile, she gestures down the path you came from. “Think about it.

True perfection, something that everyone will agree is perfect, is impossible, as someone is always likely to disagree.

And just because you grew up with a family, would you call them your family, even if you did not want to be with them, but had no choice?” \nShe puts down her teacup. “Family can be many things, but first of all it is those you love.

If two kingdoms are at war because both want the farms to keep their people alive, does it really matter which side you’re on? Both sides want the same, and both sides will attempt to take the other’s lands for their own.” \nShe puts down her teacup. “Some people have bad personalities and will act harsher than the opposing force, but that won’t change that their goals may actually be the same. You only think the other side is bad, because you’re not on that side. If you were, then your current side would be the bad one. We really should not judge those that we could have been.
